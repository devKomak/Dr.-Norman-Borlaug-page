            <li><b>1914</b> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
            <li><b>1933</b> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"National Youth Administration"</li>
            <li><b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on me."</li>
            <li><b>1937</b> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US                   Forestry &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service</li>
            <li><b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid               off &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
            <li><b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl                 Harbor &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disenfectants, and other applied science.</li>
            <li><b>1942</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant                           Pathology</li>
            <li><b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.             </li>
            <li><b>1945</b> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season,               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doubling wheat yields</li>
            <li><b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well to fertalizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wheat.</li>
            <li><b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>
            <li><b>1970</b> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
            <li><b>1983</b> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their maize and sorghum yields</li>
            <li><b>1984</b> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;University</li>
            <li><b>2005</b> - states "we will have to double the world food supply             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says             that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"we've been             genetically modifying plants and animals for a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long time. Long             before we called it science, people were &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selecting the best                 breeds."</li>
            <li><b>2009</b> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
